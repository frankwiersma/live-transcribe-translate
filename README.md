# üé§ Live Transcribe & Translate

A real-time speech transcription and translation system that captures speech and displays live captions with optional translation to multiple languages. Built for conferences, meetings, presentations, and public speaking events.

## üìñ Description

This web application listens to speech through the microphone, displays live captions, and can translate them to 11 different languages in real-time. The interface features large, readable text optimized for projection or display screens, with a clean dark theme and intuitive language selection through flag buttons.

The application processes speech continuously, applying intelligent punctuation and capitalization rules, and maintains a translation cache to improve performance during repeated phrases.

## ‚ö° Key Techniques & Technologies

The codebase demonstrates several modern web development techniques:

- **[Deepgram Speech Recognition API](https://developers.deepgram.com/)** - Professional speech-to-text with real-time streaming and high accuracy
- **[CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)** - Consistent theming with CSS variables in `:root`
- **[Flexbox Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout)** - Responsive interface layout and component alignment
- **[Local Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)** - Persistent storage of API keys across sessions
- **[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)** - HTTP requests to translation services with proper error handling
- **[CSS Backdrop Filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter)** - Blur effect behind modal dialogs
- **[Page Visibility API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API)** - Handles microphone management when tab becomes hidden/visible
- **[CSS Transforms & Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)** - Smooth animations for UI interactions
- **Async/Await Pattern** - Clean asynchronous code for API calls and speech recognition
- **Debouncing with setTimeout** - Prevents excessive API calls during continuous speech
- **Map-based Caching** - Translation cache with size limits to improve performance

## üîó External Services & Libraries

- **[Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)** - Powers the real-time translation functionality using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model
- **[FlagCDN](https://flagcdn.com/)** - Provides scalable flag images for language selection
- **System Font Stack** - Uses native OS fonts (`-apple-system`, `BlinkMacSystemFont`, `Segoe UI`, etc.) for optimal performance
